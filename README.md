# Password-Generator-App
An app using Javascript to generate a unique password. It uses prompts, alerts and confirms to collect user data about the length and which type of characters they would like to include. 

It uses 3 functions and is linked to the HTML. The Generate Password button will prompt users for a password between 10-64. If less or more, it will alert users to enter the correct number and return a value of undefined.

It will then ask users to confirm or deny use of special characters, uppercase characters, lowercase characters and numerical characters. Once choices have been made, these are entered into an empty array and the results are concatenated for random choice of password, based on the user-defined length. 

The password is then returned to the user. 

# Instructions

Use the generate button and answer the questions. 

If you would like to use the function again. You must reload the page. 

# Improvements 

In the future, I would like to improve this by enabling a reload button to clear the page and begin again.
